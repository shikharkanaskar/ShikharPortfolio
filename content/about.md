Hi! I am Shikhar.

I am currently pursuing Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Management at Purdue University. I  previously worked at ZS Associates, Inc as a Decision Analytics Associate for 2.5 years. 

For last 3 to 4 years, I have been solving various real-world problems using data-driven solutions. During my span at ZS, I partnered with several healthcare companies to solve sales, marketing and customer-reach related challenges using data science algorithms. 
I have extensive experience in delivering advanced analytics projects, client management, and presentation. This exposure to real-world data and its potential to solve problems constantly ignited a spark for innovative ideas in my mind. To bring these ideas to the table in a polished manner, to back me with a detailed awareness of evolving technologies, and to socialize with experts in the field, I joined Purdue for my masterâ€™s degree. 

At Purdue, I  completed several extensive courses such as Statistics, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Data Structures, IT Project Management, etc., while collaborating with a very diverse and experienced cohort. As I complete my master's, I am also participating in several datathons and working on various projects in machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. I also work as a student data scientist at the Krenicki Center for machine learning & business analytics at Purdue. I am working closely with an international health and beauty product company, providing robust data solutions to improve their multi-level marketing strategies.

**I am currently looking for jobs in Data Science and Analytics practice area and would be ready to join by May'2023.** To know more about me, please feel free to reach out to me on any of the platforms below.
